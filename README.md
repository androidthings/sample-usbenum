# USB Enumerator Sample

This application demonstrates accessing the `UsbManager` Android API from within
an Android Things application. The sample application iterates over all the
USB devices discovered by the host and prints their interfaces and endpoints.

> **Note:** The Android Things Console will be turned down for non-commercial
> use on January 5, 2022. For more details, see the
> [FAQ page](https://developer.android.com/things/faq).

## Pre-requisites

- Android Things compatible board
- Android Studio 2.2+

## Getting Started

Import the project using Android Studio and deploy it to your device. The
application prints the list of connected USB devices. Connect any USB peripheral
to one of the host ports on your device. The application connects to that
specific device, parses its descriptors, and prints out more detailed information
about its configuration.

## Behavior Differences

The Android [USB Host](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/usb/host.html)
APIs behave differently on Android Things because user-granted permission dialogs
are not enabled. This sample takes these changes into account, and does not
request device access permissions that would otherwise be required on an Android
mobile device.
